# AI Habit Coach

An AI-powered habit tracking application that helps users understand their daily routines by predicting next-day productivity and generating personalised insights using machine learning.

## Why this project?
As someone who started going to the gym consistently and focusing on meaningful daily habits, I tried multiple habit-tracking apps — both free and paid.  
They tracked habits, but they didn’t help me understand *why* my productivity improved or declined.

So I decided to build my own.

## Features (Planned)
- Daily habit logging (sleep, workouts, screen time, mood, focus)
- Interactive dashboard with visual analytics
- ML-based productivity prediction
- Behaviour pattern detection and personalised insights
- Clean, minimal UI

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, TailwindCSS
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- ML: scikit-learn
- Database: MongoDB
- Deployment: Netlify + Render

## Status
🚧 In development (Winter Break Project)
